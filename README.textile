h1. docset2kindle

This is a Python script to convert Apple's developer documentation to the Kindle's mobipocket format, including table of contents and chapter markers.

Requirements:
* The kindlegen commandline tool has to be downloaded separately from "Amazon":http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621
* Docsets can be downloaded with Xcode. The Mac OS X documentation set is typically located in /Developer/Documentation/DocSets, e.g. /Developer/Documentation/DocSets/com.apple.adc.documentation.AppleSnowLeopard.CoreReference.docset. The iOS documentation is usually in /Library/Developer/Documentation/DocSets.

Usage:
* Place the "kindlegen":http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621 binary in the script's directory.
* $python docset2kindle <path to docset>
* This will extract all documents of type 'Guide' or 'Getting Started' from the specified docset and put Kindle versions in an output directory (documentation for individual classes etc. is not included). The conversion may take a couple of minutes. The docset for iOS contains about 140 books, the one for Mac OS X about 340.
* It's also possible to specify a directory that contains multiple docsets.

Known Issues:
* Lists (ul, ol) don't look quite right (there's too much vertical space after the bullet point)
* Links across books don't work (I'm not sure if this is even possible with Kindle books)

To Do:
* Dynamic cover image generation
